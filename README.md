### Intelligent Dynamic Server Launcher

Only boot as many zones as you need to be idle at a time (Default: 3) (Shown: 6)

As more zones become booted by players; the server launcher will spawn additional to keep the standby pool

### Manual Backups

Manually backup your server assets with a click of a button

### Client File Exports

Tired of constantly manually exporting new client text file changes? Give your players a direct link that exports fresh data and only refreshes once a minute to prevent constant re-exports

# Requirements

* Linux or Windows
* An installation of the emulator server which runs server binaries out of the `bin` folder
* Server code that has been kept up to date as there are backend API's that the admin panel relies on the function to the fullest

# Installation

As of this writing the admin launcher is not included with the server installer, but there is plans for it to be. 

In order to install this admin panel you'll need to download a **Windows** or **Linux** release from [Releases](https://github.com/Akkadius/eqemu-web-admin/releases)

## Run the Web Interface

When you have the binary installed to the `bin` directory, you can run the web server. You can optionally pass a port number to run it on a different port

An example of what this looks like:

```
eqemu@f8905f80723c:~/server$ ./bin/eqemu-admin web
[www] Listening on port 3000
[database] MySQL Attempting to connect (default) | Host [mariadb:3306] Database [peq] User [eqemu]

```

That's it! You're ready to go! 

You will need to start the admin panel using Microsoft Services for Windows or using a process manager for Linux. Instructions for making this more "installable" as a system service will come later (Or feel free to submit a PR)

## Post Launch

Your admin panel will initialize itself when first booted. It will create an admin password you can find in your **eqemu_config.json** that can be found in its own section of the config

Different sections of the configuration will be intialize on first-use. For example the launcher configuration won't be present until you try to use the Start / Stop / Restart features of the admin panel

```
eqemu@f8905f80723c:~/server$ cat eqemu_config.json | jq '.["web-admin"]'
{
  "application": {
    "key": "<auto-generated-key>",
    "admin": {
      "password": "<auto-generated-password>"
    }
  },
  "launcher": {
    "minZoneProcesses": 3,
    "runSharedMemory": true,
    "runLoginserver": false,
    "runQueryServ": false,
    "isRunning": true
  },
  "serverCodePath": "/home/eqemu/code/"
}
```
